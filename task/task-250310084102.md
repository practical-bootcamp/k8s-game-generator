Question:
Create a Service of type LoadBalancer named 'my-service' that targets the Deployment 'myapp' on port 8080 and exposes it on port 80.

Answer:
To create a Service of type LoadBalancer named 'my-service' that targets the Deployment 'myapp' on port 8080 and exposes it on port 80, you can either use the `kubectl expose` command or create a YAML definition for the Service.

Option 1: Using kubectl command

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment myapp --type=LoadBalancer --name=my-service --port=80 --target-port=8080
```

Option 2: Using a YAML file

You can define the Service in a YAML file as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: myapp
```

To apply the YAML file, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <your-yaml-file>.yaml
```

Replace `<your-yaml-file>` with the name of your YAML file. This will create the LoadBalancer service as specified.
